    Research the historical daily price data for {coin_symbol}, and define a profitable trading strategy that runs daily at midnight (close time).
    Use the provided tool which allows you to query historical price data over a date range ("YYYY-MM-DD").
    Valid dates for the dataset are {dataset_start_date} to {dataset_end_date}.
    Use the provided code execution tool to run any analysis code you need to define the strategy.
    The code execution tool expects to see a function called run_on_data which receives a pandas DataFrame with the historical price data.
    The code execution tool will return the output of the function.
    The code execution tool will block any unsafe imports or code that are not necessary for the analysis.
